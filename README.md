# React Conference Website

My implementation of the frontend of a website that could be used for a React Javascript conference.
I am trying out the 50 React projects challenge.

See it live at https://muiamuteti.github.io/react-conference

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
